name="app_created">This app was created to give a little help and comfort to those either fighting or have survived cancer.</string><string name="hello_first_fragment">Hello first fragment</string><string name="hello_second_fragment">Hello second fragment. Arg: %1$s</string><string name="Thanks">This app is dedicated to everyone who is fighting this terrible disease, to the families and carers for whom they would not be without and to those people who helped me with my idea.
    You have all contributed to this app, from giving me feedback on my ideas, recommendations of what to add to this app and, of course, help with the inner workings of the app.  Thank you all for all of your help.  Hopefully this app will help someone out there, and if it does,
    please do not hesitate to get in contact.  Thank you.</string><string name="Intro1">Hello, my name is Aisling and I am a cancer survivor.  There are too many people that have this terrible disease.  It comes in many forms and is not caring of age, race or status.  Through my own journey,
        I found that there are numerous services and very helpful people out there, that are only too willing to help us get through this journey, as best we can.  Yes, the information provided is necessary, informative and needed.  But also, what of the personal aspect of the journey.
    I began thinking, that there has to be more.  More information, more sharing, more questions, just more. </string><string name="Intro2">Cancer patients/survivors are so very willing to help anyone and everyone else on this journey, how they managed this, what they took for that, where they found something.
        This got me thinking, that what we are lacking at this moment, is the personal information from the patients point of view, the personal connection, from one patient to another. </string><string name="Intro3">So with that in mind, I thought that I would create this app, as sort of a buddy system. The Buddy System is based on people coming together, through text, email, or whatever we so choose,
        so that we can interact with each other and ask those personal questions, that we are so afraid to ask, just in case it is a stupid question.
    The only stupid question, in my mind, is the one that goes unasked.  Please feel free to join me, on this our journey, so that we do not feel so alone and we can share thoughts, products, dietary plans, wellness, etc.</string><string name="first_paragraph_about">We lift each other up, support each other and help where we can.  Nobody understands a cancer patient like another cancer patient, regardless of what cancer each one went or is going through.</string><string name="second_paragraph_about">It will, hopefully, give you a little bit of additional information, some patient support (from other survivors) and hopefully can get you in-touch with others that can answer your personal questions.
    This is not a medical app, nor is it fully informative, when it comes to the information being shared.  Please feel free to add your own recommendations, and if there is anything that you feel is missing or would like to see added here, send it in the feedback form, found in the Help section.  All feedback is welcome.</string><string name="third_paragraph_about">Thank you, again, to everyone that has participated, gave advice, links and suggestions regarding this app.  Thank you to everyone who has participated, and to those who will, hopefully, participate in the future.  We are here for each other, come join this group
    of amazing people and help get the message out that We Are Not Alone.</string><string name="ionad_naomh_padraig">Ionad Naomh Pádraig, Dobhar</string><string name="Ionad_Info">Donegal Cancer Flights and Services Support Group is a registered charity, based in Ionad Naomh Pádraig, Gweedore.

        The Marie Keating Foundation was established in her memory and with this central ambition in mind.  The Foundations mission is to make cancer less frightening by enlightening and their aim is to live in a world free from the fear of cancer.  Today, the Marie Keating Foundation are one of the leading voices in Ireland for cancer prevention,
        awareness and support. The Foundation is committed to being there for people diagnosed with cancer, and their families at every step of this cancer journey, and their services reflect that. Through their information and support services, they reach thousands of people a year, giving education, information and advice focused on cancer prevention and early detection,
        as well as providing support services and financial assistance to those living with and beyond cancer.  The Foundations team of 17 and their Board works tirelessly to ensure that the mission and legacy that the Keating Family established 22 years ago is fulfilled, and everyone in Ireland has access to trusted information on cancer prevention and early detection and
        that those on a cancer journey have the support they need to come through it.</string><string name="daffodil_cr">Daffodil Centre, Letterkenny</string><string name="Daffodil_Cr">The Irish Cancer Society is a community of patients, survivors, volunteers, supporters, health and social care professionals and researchers, determined to help anyone affected by cancer in Ireland.

WHY DO WE RELAY NON – STOP FOR 24 HOURS? BECAUSE CANCER NEVER SLEEPS.
        Relay for Life represents the hope that those who have lost their lives to cancer will never be forgotten, that those who face cancer will be supported and that one day we will live in a cancer free world.</string><string name="macmillan"> Macmillan</string><string name="Macmillan"> Macmillan Cancer Support helps people in the UK, the North of Ireland and also help patients from the Republic of Ireland.  Without their great support and services, the NorthWest Cancer Care Unit, Derry, we, in Donegal, have to travel to either Dublin or Galway, for services that are only a short distance past Letterkenny.
    This journey helps patients that have had Radiotherapy and other treatments, return home, or stay in the NorthWest Cancer Services patient rooms (for the duration of their treatment), having this service so near, helps patients and their families cope that little bit better with treatments.</string><string name="Diet">These are recommendations from others and what worked for them.  Some people found that either before, during or after chemo and-or other treatments,
        that their diet had to be changed, either by the nursing staff in the hospital, their own doctor, or from personal choice.  Here are a few "alternative" diet sites that are available to all.</string><string name="Shops">These are recommendations based on shops that were helpful.  When I say helpful, I mean chemists/pharmacies that were more than helpful, listening to me personally, and giving me feedback and/or really good advice; I also mean shops that went above and
     beyond, when it came to helping me out, for example, if I needed a delivery on a day that they were not delivering, they knew my circumstances and they delivered, wholehartedly, for as long as I needed them.  Below are a few of these particular shops.</string><string name="Gallaghers">This is a family run supermarket.  If they have it and you need it, they will get it to you.  If they know that your health is not what it should be, they will deliver to your door, whenever you need them to.  This additional service, that they provide,
    helps the customer with one less thing that they need to take care of.  We, in the Gweedore area, would be lost without them.</string><string name="Healthwise">The owner of this Healthwise Pharmacy, James Cassidy, is extremely helpful with additional knowledge that a person might need.  His staff are brilliant, friendly and very knowledgeable, with regards to all items in the shop.  What they do not know, they will find out for you.
    James and Yvonne, the regular pharmacists, try their very best, to help customers, in any way that they can.  Sometimes, this even means that you do not have to make that extra trip to the doctor, as help is at hand.</string><string name="TotalHealth">This family pharmacy was established in 1993 by Rory ODonnell, along with his parents Paddy and Evelyn ODonnell.  The pharmacy is known for its fantastic service and personal touch, with many of the regular staff working there from the beginning.
    The team at ODonnells totalhealth Pharmacy will always go the extra mile for you.</string><string name="SleepyPaws">Sleepy Paws is a dog kennel in Gortahork and is run by Bertina Roarty-Whitley and family.  Without Bertina, her family and her kennels, I do not know what we, as a family, would have done with our dogs.  She is one in a million and has a family that are the same.
    I will never be able to repay her kindness nor her help, she took my dogs into her own home, when there was no space for them in the kennels, because I was in hospital and my son was at school and could not give them the care that they needed.
    Her daughter sat with all the dogs and read them stories, she still works with them to this day.  They are a caring, loving, professional business that take you and your dogs in and you become part of their family.  I can not recommend Sleepy Paws enough.
    Bertina grooms the dogs, takes them on long walks, has an obstacle course at the house, which she uses during the dogs summer camps and on top of all that she will perform Reiki on a nervous dog, to calm them down during a grooming session.  Such a wonderful service,
    and I am very grateful to have found this place.</string><string name="title_activity_custom_on_item_selected_listener">CustomOnItemSelectedListener</string><string name="Library">There are numerous books on cancer and diet in the Public Library and they are free of charge.

Some places, I have spoken to and have gotten their permission, others, I could not reach them, but wanted to have them listed here for their product health benefits to people of all ages, who want to make lifestyle changes starting with their diet.</string><string name="RecommendShops">Happy Pear, Whole Earth Organics, Donegal Wheatgrass, happycow.net (they supply Wholegreen Shot Lky).</string><string name="RecommendMeals">Another thought was, to have ready made meals, which can be purchased two days a week at Ionad Naomh Padraig, Dore, or at SmartMeals.ie (to have set meals pre-made for the week, for the days that you might not want or are unfit to cook, from Micis Pub, Derrybeg).</string><string name="Wellness">Wellness means different things to different people.  To me it is about mind, body and soul. If one is out of sync, then the rest are as well.  To obtain true wellness, there are numerous ways to go about achieving it.
        For me, here, it just means exercise (either at home or at a gym), meditation (mind-exercise), diet - eating right, knowledge of what your are eating, right foods and wrong foods (see recommendations in the Diet section of this app). To find out about meditation, see if there is a yoga studio locally, look at YouTube, talk to your local community centres, or just be still in a room for a while and breathe, yes, just breathe.</string><string name="Atlantic_Gym">Atlantic Strength and Fitness is a gym that specialises in one to one training and transformations.

Most of this information is probably supplied through your cancer care nurse, the Daffodil Center or Look Good Feel Better, but I thought that it was worth another mention.</string><string name="Genesis">Genesis Salon, Dore, is a wonderful, extremely relaxing, comfortable Hair and Beauty spa type Salon.

Not everyone needs to wear a wig, through this journey, but for those that do, they do not necessarily want to constantly wear a wig everyday.
    Here is where Ursula has come up with her turban type headgear, that is fun to wear, light and as colourful as you are or want to be.  Please have a look.</string><string name="Makeup">The thing about makeup and cancer is that cancer will change your skin type, maybe not forever, but it will change it for a time.  Within this time, you need to know what to wear, what not to wear, what is gentle on your skin, what you will not be allergic to and so on.
    Therefore, it is important to take very good care of your skin.</string><string name="Clothing">Clothing, for anyone who has undergone certain types of surgery, can be hard to find, hard to fit, and just hard to be inspired to go and look.  You can recommend your own personal stores and what worked for you, in the Your Recommendations section.</string><string name="McElhinneys">McElhinneys, as any Donegal person knows, is a high-end store, with big brand names.
